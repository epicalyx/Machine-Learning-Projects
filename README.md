Helpful resources and credits : https://appliedmachinelearning.blog/2017/01/23/email-spam-filter-python-scikit-learn/ and https://www.kaggle.com/benvozza/spam-classification/notebook These resources helped me in learning the flow of a text classification project and I have included code snippets from these posts according to my own understanding of the concepts.
